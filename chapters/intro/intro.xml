	<title>High Performance Programming and OSX</title>

<para>It took Apple a long time, and the purchase of an ex-founder's company
to do it, but they finally have a cutting-edge operating system running
on their hardware. At the core of OS X is a very old technology--Unix.
OS X's combination of advanced features and Unix underpinning has
brought many developers to the Apple platform. In fact, it is very easy
for a programmer to bring their existing Unix bag of tricks to the OS X
table and be very productive.</para>

<para>what does this do for them though? They would be missing out on some
great technology like: obj-c, DO, Cocoa, Quartz, Mach. so, that is what this 
book aims to cover.</para>

<para>We are taught to code first, then profile, then optimize. This leaves out the critical step of program design, which can have just as much, or more impact on the <emphasis>ultimate</emphasis> speed our program is able to achieve. By not thinking about performance at all, we risk creating a program that is unable to achieve its goals.</para>

<para>It is important to strike the right balance.</para>
